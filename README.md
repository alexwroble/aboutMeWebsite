# aboutMeWebsite

I am starting this project with the goal of advancing my skills with Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. This website is a professional website designed by myself, Alexander Wroble, allowing others to visit and see not only my programming skills, but also learn more about myself. :)
